# pilviparking

This project checks automatically how many cars are in a parking lot using Yolov4.

Also you can check the current situation from the website which uses OpenStreetMaps. ( not currently running )

Tested in Oulu campus and it showed current free parking slots with Â± 1 accuracy.

We used Raspberry Pi and a Camera to send a picture to our server which had Yolov4 running and it sent the result to our website.
