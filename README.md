# pilviparking

This project checks automatically how many cars are in a parking lot using Yolov4.\n
Also you can check the current situation from the website which uses OpenStreetMaps. ( not currently running )
Tested in Oulu campus and it showed current free parking slots with Â± 1 accuracy.
We used Raspberry Pi and a Camera to send a picture to our server which had Yolov4 running and it gave a reading of how many cars were on the parking lot.
